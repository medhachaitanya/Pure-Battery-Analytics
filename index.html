    <p>I am sure each one of us have had their own crests and troughs in 2021. I have had my very low times but yes, in
        2021, I've graduated with a masters in computer science degree. It was over-whelming, especially during my last
        semester but for most of the times, I enjoyed learning new things. Thank you for your "May the force be with you
        & Good luck with your school" e-mails. 2021, has also introduced me to a wonderful person, Victor. We became
        friends via this app's feedback emails. 😄 Overall, I'm joyous 🥳 but at the same time bewildered 😕 as I now
        have a mountain 🌋 of education loan 💵 to clear 😔.
        <br />With the year leaving us only a few days before coming to an end, I have a couple of December updates for
        our app, Pure Battery Analytics below.
        <li>Upgraded the icons to the latest Windows Fluent System</li>
        <li>Enhanced Performance and</li>
        <li>Insights into which apps are taking most of your battery/energy</li>
        <li>Finally, the most requested feature, Dark Mode.</li>

        My dad used to tell me, "Always wish good for others and good things will automatically happen to you. That's
        what is called 'Karma'."
        I hope & wish you have a great holiday time and a wonderful year a head. Thank you again.
