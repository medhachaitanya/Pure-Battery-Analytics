        <br/>

    <p class="lead">A Tale of the Space Bar üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è </p>

    <p>

Dear All,
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the recent app issue that has caused inconvenience and frustration for many of you. I deeply regret the inconvenience caused and the issue has been fixed and an update has been released (v1.25.161). Allow me to shed some light on what transpired and explain the unexpected role of a humble space (' ') in this situation.
<br/>
<br/>
In my constant pursuit of innovation, I strive to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience through my applications. However, as with any technology, unforeseen issues can arise. This time, the culprit was an elusive space (' ') character lurking in the code, causing unexpected disruptions within the app's functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
It is important to note that this issue was not apparent during my extensive testing phases. The app worked flawlessly during the testing process, and the space went unnoticed as it innocuously blended into the code. Unfortunately, the issue only became evident after the app was deployed in the production environment.
<br/>
<br/>
The elusive nature of this bug made it incredibly challenging to identify and rectify. I worked tirelessly, combing through the code and running countless tests to locate and resolve the issue. I apologize for the time it took to address this matter (7 days) and for any frustration it may have caused.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to assure you that I have thoroughly investigated the problem and have implemented additional measures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to serving you better in the future.
<br/>
<br/>

    <p class="lead">Thoughts from the developer, Medha Karri</p>
    <p class="lead">Dec 19, 2021; 03:43PM EST</p>
    <p class="lead">Wishing you all merry christmas and a very happy new year 2022! </p>

    <p>I am sure each one of us have had their own crests and troughs in 2021. I have had my very low times but yes, in
        2021, I've graduated with a masters in computer science degree. It was over-whelming, especially during my last
        semester but for most of the times, I enjoyed learning new things. Thank you for your "May the force be with you
        & Good luck with your school" e-mails. 2021, has also introduced me to a wonderful person, Victor. We became
        friends via this app's feedback emails. üòÑ Overall, I'm joyous ü•≥ but at the same time bewildered üòï as I now
        have a mountain üåã of education loan üíµ to clear üòî.
        <br />With the year leaving us only a few days before coming to an end, I have a couple of December updates for
        our app, Pure Battery Analytics below.
        <li>Upgraded the icons to the latest Windows Fluent System</li>
        <li>Enhanced Performance and</li>
        <li>Insights into which apps are taking most of your battery/energy</li>
        <li>Finally, the most requested feature, Dark Mode.</li>

        <br />Thank you for making <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH4X4K3">Pure Battery
            Analytics</a>, one of the best rated battery apps for Windows 10 on the Microsoft store.
        My dad used to tell me, "Always wish good for others and good things will automatically happen to you. That's
        what is called 'Karma'."
        I hope & wish you have a great holiday time and a wonderful year a head. Thank you again.
